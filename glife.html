        <p> Chlorpyrifos works by inhibiting acetyl cholinesterase (AChE), which is an enzyme that degrades neurotransmitters.On concrete slabs under construction, treat the outside of the foundation wall trenches with 6 – 12 litres of the solution per linear meter and to the depths of 40 -75 cm. replace the soil and apply another 8 – 16 litres of the solution per linear meter and cover the trench and fill the treated soil with a thin layer of untreated soil.

          On mud floor houses under construction, treat the external surfaces of the poles’ holes with the solution to the depth of 40 – 75 cm. Dip the poles into the solution. Treat as for building under construction.
          
          On Termites nests, remove the top 15 cm of the soil and pour the solution down the tunnels. Replace the soils after treatment.
          
          On lawns and gardens, spray affected areas at the rates of 1.5 litres of the solution per 10 square meters
          
          On timber, use 1 L per 24 litres of water and spray the timber thoroughly. Soak mounds of the fencing poles for 30 minutes and treat the soil in holes by pouring in the solution by the watering can or bucket
          
          On forest trees, apply 10 – 20 ml per 1 L of water, depending on severity of termite infection, drench the base of the tree, followed by irrigation of enough water.
          
          Undertaker® 480EC can be applied as a direct spray on construction wood and be drenched at the base of trees. DO NOT apply to soils if excessively wet, immediately after heavy rain or if heavy rains are expected within 48 hours to avoid run-off of chemical.</p>

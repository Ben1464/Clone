    <p><quote>Pulses are locally adapted to different areas and can be grown by Farmers for their own nutrition or for sale boosting income and reduce risks by diversifying crops and income portfolio.

        Pulses make up 75 percent of the average diet of most households in developing countries compared to 25 percent in industrialized countries.  They are an affordable alternative to animal protein, and can be found in dishes like falafel, daal, chili, and even baked beans. Pulses can be stored for months on end without losing their high nutritional value. This trait is particularly valuable for smallholder farmers who depend on the food they store between harvests</quote></p> <hr>

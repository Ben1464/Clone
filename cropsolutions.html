        <h1>Courgettes Nutrition</h1>
        <img src="https://www.greenlife.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/courgette_nutrition-1024x512.jpg" width="900" height="400">
        <p>Courgettes are relatively heavy users of nutrients and thus need sufficient nutrients supply for optimal productivity. A proper nutrition is achieved by supplying the crop with both macro and micronutrients and both basal and foliar fertilizers are recommended.Courgettes are relatively heavy users of nutrients and thus need sufficient nutrients supply for optimal productivity.

            A proper nutrition is achieved by supplying the crop with both macro and micronutrients and both basal and foliar fertilizers are recommended.
            
            Macronutrients are needed in large quantities and include Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium and Calcium, among others, while micronutrient elements are required in relatively low amounts but are very crucial in plant’s functions. They include Zinc, Iron, Boron, among others.
            
            Basal fertilizers are absorbed by the crop through the roots, e.g., DAP, CAN, while foliar fertilizers are absorbed through the foliage, e.g. OPTIMIZER, GOLDCHANCE, etc.
            
            Application of manure is necessary for soils not rich in organic matter. It releases its nutrients slowly throughout the growing period and adds organic matter to the soil. </p>

        <h2>Mangoes</h2>
        <img src="https://www.greenlife.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mango_cover-1024x512.jpg" width="900" height="400">
        <p>Mango belongs to the family anacardiceae whose botanical name is magnifera indica. The plant is believed to have originated from South and South East Asia.Mango farming in Kenya is done mostly done in the coastal region and eastern parts of Kenya. Mangoes are eaten raw as dessert fruits or may be processed to various products.[dt_fancy_title title=”ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS” title_align=”left” title_size=”h6″ title_color=”accent” separator_style=”thick” separator_color=”custom” custom_separator_color=”#f2f2f2″]

            Temperatures
            Mango do best on average annual temperature of between 15 to 30 degrees centigrade.
            
            Rainfall.
            Annual rainfall of 850 to 1000mm is sufficient for mango cultivation. It should be noted that rainfall during flowering season reduces fruit setting. After the plant is well established it can tolerate drought especially when its tap root reaches the water table.
            
            Soils
            Mango plants are adapted to many soil types but prefer deep(at least 3m)soils that are fertile and well drained with optimum PH of 5.5to 7.5.
            
            Suitable growing areas in Kenya.
            Mango do well in low land to upper midland areas. Most suitable areas in Kenya include coastal areas, Murang’a, Thika Taveta, lower Embu, Machakos, Makueni and Kitui.[dt_fancy_title title=”VARIETIES” title_align=”left” title_size=”h6″ title_color=”accent” separator_style=”thick” separator_color=”custom” custom_separator_color=”#f2f2f2″]There are two types of mango varieties grown in Kenya i.e. the local and the exotic varieties. Exotic mangoes are grafted on the local varieties. Local varieties include Dodo, Boribo,and Batawi. While the exotic varieties include Apple, Tommy and Kent among others.[vc_single_image image=”1221″ img_size=”full” alignment=”center”][dt_fancy_title title=”PESTS AND DISEASES” title_align=”left” title_size=”h6″ title_color=”accent” separator_style=”thick” separator_color=”custom” custom_separator_color=”#f2f2f2″]PESTS[vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=”1/2″]Mango Seed Weevil.
            
            Adult weevils are dark brown with grey markings. They are 6 to 9 cm long and possess typical features of weevils with strong exoskeleton. The female weevil lays eggs on young fruits. After the egg hutches the larvae tunnels in to the fruit through the flesh and reaches the seeds where they complete the life cycle.
            
            Control
            
            Spray emerald@ 10ml/20l or Loyalty @5g/20l.</p>

        <img src="https://www.greenlife.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/early_blight.jpg" width="900" height="400">
        <p>Early blight is a fungal disease caused by a fungus Alternaria solani, which mostly affects tomato and potato plants, causing significant losses if not effectively controlled.

            The disease can also occur on other solanaceous crops like eggplant, capsicum etc.</p>

        <h4>Understanding Farmer Training</h4>
        <img src="https://www.greenlife.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Impact-of-farmer-training-to-agricultural-success.jpg" width="900" height="400">
        <p>Farmer knowledge through farmer training involves understanding of farm materials, cash and information flows generated in the process of production and exchange of his/her goods and services associated with the farm while agricultural success is the ability of the utilized farm inputs and activities to give maximum outputs including growth in country’s economy.

            Therefore, farmer training help to ensure that they stay aware of fast moving developments in technology, science, agri-business management, and other skills and fields which ensures a success in agriculture.The results of impacting farmers with different farming methods and techniques of agricultural production increases their efficiency and thus success in agriculture.</p>

        <h5>Squash vine bore</h5>
        <img src="https://www.greenlife.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/squash_vine_borer.jpg" width="900" height="400">
        <p>The squash vine borer is a serious pest of vine crops, commonly attacking squash, pumpkins, and gourds. Cucumbers, butternuts, and melons are less frequently affected.

            These insect pests usually occur in low numbers although their presence is usually not noticed until after the damage is done.
            
            The larval stage burrows in the plant stem or crown, disrupting the transport of water and nutrients, which results in wilting of affected plants or stems
            
            In home gardens, the entire crops may be lost in cases of high borer populations</p>
